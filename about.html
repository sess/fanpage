                "A cereal is any of the edible 
                components of the grain (botanically, a type of fruit, called a caryopsis) of cultivated grass, 
                composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and 
                provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop[1] and are therefore staple crops.
                Edible grains from other plant families, such as buckwheat (Polygonaceae), 
                quinoa (Amaranthaceae) and chia (Lamiaceae), are referred to as pseudocereals.

                In their natural, unprocessed, whole grain form, cereals are a rich source of vitamins, minerals, 
                carbohydrates, fats, oils, and protein. When processed by the removal of the bran, and germ, 
                the remaining endosperm is mostly carbohydrate. In some developing countries, grain in the form of rice,
                wheat, millet, or maize constitutes a majority of daily sustenance. In developed countries, 
                cereal consumption is moderate and varied but still substantial."

                 "While each individual species has its own peculiarities, the cultivation of all cereal crops is similar. Most are annual plants; consequently one planting yields one harvest. Wheat, rye, triticale, oats, 
                 barley, and spelt are the "cool-season" cereals.[citation needed] 
                 These are hardy plants that grow well in moderate weather and cease to grow in hot weather (approximately 30 °C [86 °F], but this varies by species and variety). The "warm-season" cereals are tender and prefer hot weather. Barley and rye are the hardiest cereals,
                 able to overwinter in the subarctic and Siberia. 
                 Many cool-season cereals are grown in the tropics. However, some are only grown in cooler highlands, where it may be possible to grow multiple crops per year."
